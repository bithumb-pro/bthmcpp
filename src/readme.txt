This is the source of libBthmCPP which is CPP Library for Bithumb Pro API, running make in this folder will compile libbthmcpp.so from source.

The libbthmcpp.so compiled will be generated in ../lib/libbthmcpp/lib and the headers in ../lib/libbthmcpp/include 

You only need to recompile the src here if you need to modify the source of libBthmCPP.





To use the library in your C++ project,  just do -I<path to libBthmCPP include> and -L<path to libBthmCPP lib> and a -lbthmcpp for linker.

You can view the examples in ../example folder for references on how to use libBthmCPP.
